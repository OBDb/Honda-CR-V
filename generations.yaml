    description: "The original Honda CR-V (RD1) was introduced in Japan in October 1995 and hit North American markets in February 1997. Designed by Hiroyuki Kawase, it was Honda's first in-house designed sport utility vehicle built on a modified Civic platform. Powered by a 2.0L B20B/B20Z four-cylinder engine paired with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, it offered practical, car-like performance. Notable for its unique externally-mounted spare tire and side-hinged rear door, removable picnic table, and Real Time AWD system that engaged automatically when slippage was detected. The 2000 model year received a facelift with an improved B20Z engine producing 147 hp, new front bumper design, and smoothed rear styling. This generation established the CR-V as a pioneer in the emerging car-based crossover SUV segment."

    end_year: 2006
    description: "The second generation CR-V went on sale November 12, 2001 (2002 model year) as a full redesign based on the seventh-generation Civic platform. It was powered by the 2.4L K24A1 engine (or K20A4 in Southeast Asia) with i-VTEC technology, producing 160 hp in North America. The exterior-mounted spare tire and side-hinged door gave way to an upward-opening tailgate and internally-stored spare tire, reflecting mainstream appeal. The new unibody design with increased torsional rigidity and improved suspension allowed for significantly more cargo space (72 cu ft). The front suspension used MacPherson struts with toe-control links, while the rear featured a reactive-link double-wishbone design. The interior saw major improvements in materials, space, and features. In 2004, the mid-cycle refresh introduced new 16-inch wheels, redesigned lights, drive-by-wire throttle, and five-speed automatic transmission. Named Car and Driver Best Small SUV for 2002 and 2003."

Powered by a 2.4L K-series inline-four engine rated at 166 hp and 161 lbft in North America, with a 2.2L i-CTDI diesel available in Europe and Asia. The European market received the 2.0L R20A gasoline engine instead. The 2010 model year featured a mid-cycle refresh with redesigned front fascia, new horizontal-slat chrome grille, honeycomb lower grille, revised tail lights, and new alloy wheels.
