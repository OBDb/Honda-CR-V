generations:
  - name: "First Generation"
    start_year: 1995
    end_year: 2001
    description: "The original Honda CR-V was introduced as a 'Comfortable Runabout Vehicle' to capitalize on the growing compact SUV segment. Built on a modified Civic platform, it featured a unique design with an externally mounted spare tire and a side-hinged rear door. Powered primarily by a 2.0L four-cylinder engine paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission, it offered modest performance focused on everyday usability rather than off-road capability. Available with front-wheel drive or Real Time 4WD (which engaged automatically when slippage was detected), it positioned itself as a practical, car-like alternative to more rugged SUVs. The interior featured clever design elements including a removable folding picnic table stored in the cargo floor. This generation established the CR-V as a pioneer in the car-based crossover SUV category that would eventually dominate the market."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The second-generation CR-V evolved with more conventional SUV styling while maintaining its car-based underpinnings. The exterior-mounted spare tire and side-hinged door were replaced with an upward-opening tailgate and internally stored spare, reflecting a shift toward more mainstream appeal. Power increased with an improved 2.4L four-cylinder engine, while maintaining the option of front-wheel drive or enhanced Real Time 4WD. The interior grew in both space and refinement, with improved materials and features including an available moonroof and upgraded audio systems. Safety features expanded to include standard ABS, front airbags, and available side airbags. This generation broadened the CR-V's market appeal, helping it become one of Honda's best-selling models globally as consumer preferences began shifting from traditional cars to crossover SUVs."

  - name: "Third Generation"
    start_year: 2007
    end_year: 2011
    description: "The third-generation CR-V featured more carlike styling and driving dynamics, reflecting the market's shift away from traditional SUV design cues. The exterior adopted a more aerodynamic shape with a reduced ride height compared to its predecessor. Powered by a refined 2.4L four-cylinder engine with improved efficiency and performance, it maintained the choice between front-wheel drive and an enhanced Real Time 4WD system. The interior saw significant improvements in design, material quality, and feature content, including available leather seating, navigation, and a rear-view camera on higher trims. A notable innovation was the elimination of the traditional parking brake handle in favor of a space-saving electronic parking brake. This generation further established the CR-V as a benchmark in the rapidly growing compact crossover segment, emphasizing passenger comfort and everyday usability."

  - name: "Fourth Generation"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The fourth-generation CR-V refined the formula with evolutionary styling changes and significant mechanical improvements. The exterior featured a more aggressive front fascia and dynamic character lines, while maintaining the CR-V's recognizable profile. Powered initially by a carried-over 2.4L four-cylinder, a mid-cycle refresh introduced a new 2.4L Earth Dreams engine with direct injection and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) replacing the previous five-speed automatic. The interior offered improved materials, design, and technology, including Honda's i-MID information display and available touchscreen infotainment system. Cargo functionality was enhanced with a lower load floor and easy-fold rear seats that could be operated with a single strap. Safety technology advanced with the introduction of Honda's LaneWatch blind spot camera and available driver assistance features. This generation maintained the CR-V's position as a segment leader while improving efficiency, technology, and refinement."

  - name: "Fifth Generation"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The fifth-generation CR-V featured more distinctive styling with prominent LED lighting elements and a longer, wider stance. For the first time, a turbocharged engine became the primary powertrainâ€”a 1.5L turbo four-cylinder offering improved performance and efficiency compared to the previous naturally aspirated engine. A hybrid variant joined the lineup in 2020, combining a 2.0L Atkinson-cycle engine with electric motors for enhanced efficiency. The interior saw significant improvements in material quality, design, and technology, featuring a floating touchscreen, digital instrument cluster elements, and improved connectivity options. Passenger space increased in all dimensions, particularly rear legroom, while cargo capacity remained class-leading. Safety technology advanced considerably with Honda Sensing becoming standard across most of the lineup, offering features like adaptive cruise control, collision mitigation braking, and lane keeping assist. This generation reinforced the CR-V's position as a benchmark in the compact crossover segment, consistently ranking among the best-selling vehicles in America."

  - name: "Sixth Generation"
    start_year: 2023
    end_year: null
    description: "The current CR-V features a complete redesign with more rugged styling cues, including a longer hood, upright grille, and stronger horizontal elements. Slightly larger than its predecessor in all dimensions, it offers increased passenger and cargo space. Powertrain options include an enhanced 1.5L turbocharged four-cylinder and a significantly improved hybrid system that now serves as the performance option with 204 HP combined output. The interior represents a major advancement with a horizontal dashboard design featuring a standard 7-inch touchscreen (9-inch available) and 7-inch digital instrument display. Materials and build quality have improved noticeably, with a more premium feel across all trim levels. Technology has advanced with standard Honda Sensing safety features, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto on higher trims, and available Google built-in services. The hybrid variant now accounts for a larger portion of the model mix and comes standard with all-wheel drive. This generation aims to maintain the CR-V's position as a segment leader while offering more distinctive styling, improved refinement, and enhanced electrification options as the market shifts toward hybrid technology."
