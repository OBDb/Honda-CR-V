## Generations

The Honda CR-V has evolved through six generations since its introduction in 1995, becoming one of the world's best-selling compact SUVs:

- **First Generation (1995-2001)**: Launched initially in Japan, then globally by 1997, the first CR-V established the model's core identity. Built on the Civic platform, it featured a 2.0L B20B engine and Real Time 4WD system. Notable for its unique exterior-mounted spare tire and integrated picnic table.

- **Second Generation (2002-2006)**: Brought significant refinements with a more car-like unibody design. Powered by the K24A1 engine (2.4L, i-VTEC), it offered improved performance and interior space. This generation introduced a lift-up rear glass hatch and eliminated the exterior-mounted spare tire.

- **Third Generation (2007-2011)**: Featured a complete redesign with a lower floor for improved access and handling. The 2.4L K24Z engine received updates for better efficiency, and the interior saw significant upgrades in quality and features. First generation to offer a luxury-oriented trim level.

- **Fourth Generation (2012-2016)**: Introduced a more aggressive styling direction and improved aerodynamics. Featured an updated 2.4L engine with direct injection in later years. Notable for introducing Honda's first CVT in the CR-V and enhanced safety features like forward collision warning.

- **Fifth Generation (2017-2022)**: Marked a significant shift with its first turbocharged engine (1.5L) as standard in most markets. Introduced the first CR-V Hybrid variant (2020) in North America. Featured Honda SensingÂ® safety suite as standard equipment and improved interior quality.

- **Sixth Generation (2023-present)**: Represents the most substantial redesign in CR-V history. Features a more rugged exterior design, larger dimensions, and enhanced hybrid powertrain system. Offers either a standard 1.5L turbocharged engine or an improved hybrid system with Honda's two-motor technology. Notable for its larger cargo area, enhanced technology features, and comprehensive safety systems.
